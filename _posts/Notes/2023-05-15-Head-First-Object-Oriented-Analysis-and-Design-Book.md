# Chapter 1: Great Software Begins Here

this chapter starts with *what is the great software?* question and going to discuss it with a deferent point of views. For example 
- The *customer friend* sees that the great software does what the customer wants it to do and doesn't give un expected result when we use it in a new way.
- The *Object-Oriented Programming* guy sees that the great software has no code duplication, each object controls its own behavior, and finally easy to be extended.
- The *Design Pattern* guy sees that the great software is what used a tried-and-true design patterns and principles. Objects are loosely coupled, Open for extension but closed for modifications. finally the code in the software must be reusable.
- A *Computer science* student in BFCAI that called Hossam Hamdy sees that the great software is the one which following the best design practices and design patterns to not re invent the wheel again, that software that respect customer requirements but in the same time we don't ignore the engineering side.

The Authors provide an approach for writing a great software with a simple steps:
**1. Make sure your software does what customer wants it to do.**
**2. Apply basic OO principles to add flexibilities.**
**3. Strive for a maintainable reusable design.**

In this chapter the authors learn me a new thing about *Encapsulation*, we can use it not only for information hiding, but also we can use it to remove duplicated codes. in the following code snippet we have the Guitar class that used in a *ArrayList <Guitar> search(Guitar guitar)*
That implemented to take each class data member and compare with the client needs. 

```java
public class Guitar {  
    private String serialNumber;
    private double price;
    private Builder builder;
    private String model;
    private Type type;
    private Wood backWood;
    private Wood topWood;
    public String getSerialNumber() {return serialNumber;}
    public void setSerialNumber(String serialNumber) {this.serialNumber = serialNumber;}
    public double getPrice() {return price;}
    public void setPrice(double price) {this.price = price;}
    public Builder getBuilder() {return builder;}
    public void setBuilder(Builder builder) {this.builder = builder;}
    public String getModel() {return model;}
    public void setModel(String model) {this.model = model;}
    public Type getType() {return type;}
    public void setType(Type type) {this.type = type;}
    public Wood getBackWood() {return backWood;}
    public void setBackWood(Wood backWood) {this.backWood = backWood;}
    public Wood getTopWood() {return topWood;}
    public void setTopWood(Wood topWood) {this.topWood = topWood;}
 }
 ```

The problem is that the client doesn't really care about guitar serial number or price so that he doesn't provide the search method with this information which make the search method doesn't do its job properly because some data members are Null.
so that we can use the Encapsulation to separate the not necessary data from the Guitar object to a new object used for searching such as *GuitarSpec* that hold all necessary information about the target guitar.

The new Guitar Class code: 

```java
public class Guitar {
    private String serialNumber;
    private double price;
    // each guitar object must have a GuitarSpec object to descripe it.
    private GuitarSpec guitarSpec;
    public String getSerialNumber(){
	    return serialNumber;
	}  
    public void setSerialNumber(String serialNumber) {
	    this.serialNumber = serialNumber;
	} 
    public GuitarSpec getGuitarSpec() {
	    return serialNumber;
	}  
    public void setGuitarSpec(GuitarSpec guitarSpec) {
	    this.guitarSpec = guitarSpec;
	}
 }
```

The GuitarSpec Class code: 

```java
public class GuitarSpec {  
    private Builder builder;  
    private String model;  
    private Type type;  
    private Wood backWood;  
    private Wood topWood;  
    public Builder getBuilder() {return builder;}  
    public void setBuilder(Builder builder) {this.builder = builder;}  
    public String getModel() {return model;}  
    public void setModel(String model) {this.model = model;}  
    public Type getType() {return type;}  
    public void setType(Type type) {this.type = type;}  
    public Wood getBackWood() {return backWood;}  
    public void setBackWood(Wood backWood) {this.backWood = backWood;}  
    public Wood getTopWood() {return topWood;}  
    public void setTopWood(Wood topWood) {this.topWood = topWood;}  
 }
```

With this approach we have a good design because in the future if we wanna add a new prosperity to the Guitar we don't need to change the guitar class each time we have a new changes, we just need to add it into the GuitarSpec and the *search()* method will do it's job. we separate application's parts and encapsulate the part tat might vary/change away from the parts that will stay the same.
**`Anytime you see duplicate code, look for a place to encapsulate`**.

**Delegation** The act of one object forwarding an operation to another object, to be performed on behalf of the first object. such as *.equals()* method in java. delegation enables the code reusability, and make it **loosely coupled** (the object have a specific job to do and they do only that job).

| Idiom | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
| Functionality | Without me, you’ll never actually make the customer happy. No matter how well-designed your application is, I’m the thing that puts a smile on the customer’s face |
| Flexibility | Use me so that your software can change and grow without constant rework. I keep your application from being fragile |
| Encapsulation | You use me to keep the parts of your code that stay the same separate from the parts that change; then it’s really easy to make changes to your code without breaking everything |
| Design Pattern | I’m all about reuse and making sure you’re not trying to solve a problem that someone else has already figured out. |

# Chapter 02: Gathering Requirements

In this chapter the authors will introduce a simple approach to help you to gather customer requirements with detailed use cases.
Let’s answer the questions of What is the requirement?
*Requirement* is a specific thing your system has to do to work correctly. It's about what a particular service should do.


### Listen to the customer
To gather requirements, we need to listen to the customer carefully and pay attention to everything he says about the system wanna have/ or feature wanna add. In listening phase, we care about **what system has to do? ** not **How we'll implement this? **

Focusing on implementation details in this phase is a big mistake that i unfortunately do in meetings. This makes me drop some necessary details in requirements and start thinking about the limitations of used technologies or on the other side start saying "yes it's easy we can implement and deliver this method/feature in 3 hours" but it's not true at all 😩.


### Create Requirements List

After we listen to the customer requirements, we need to create a list of them as the image below.

After creating the list, we validate requirements with the customer to make sure that we are all on the same level of understanding of what the system has to do. We can get approval in the best case, and also, we get some comments on the requirements list as a change needed.

Be aware that the happy case doesn't always happen in our real world, so our requirements might have an *alternative paths* that handle the situation when things going wrong and unexpected.

the *Use case* idiom describes what your system does to accomplish a particular customer goal. it provides one or more scenarios that convey how the system should interact with the end-user or another system to achieve a goal.


**One great use case is consists of 3 parts:**

| Part | Description |
|:--:|:--:|
| Clear value | The use case must have a clear value to our system, if it’s not then the use case isn't of much use |
| Start and Stop Condition | Each use case mush have a defined starting and ending conditions. when to start and when the process must be ended |
| External Initiator | Each use case is started by external actor outside the system |


The use case must be written in a clear language to be understandable for your customers, managers, and developers’ team. so that the use case doesn't have technical details.

You might think writing use cases is a waste of time and effort, but it's not what you think. Writing use cases helps you to figure out the edge cases and alternative paths that happens when things go wrong. By thinking about coding without take care of well written use cases we just think about happy scenarios only, the use case helps us to be aware of what we might face in the future. Remember that the first step of writing a great software is having satisfied customers.

### Check requirements against use cases
The last step is to check requirements against use cases, this helps us in validate the requirements and have the green light to start coding 🙂. here we make sure that all gathered requirements are covering all system aspects and functionalities.

# Chapter 03: Requirements Change

In this short chapter, the authors introduce the "**Change**" concept in the OOA&D world as it is the only constant. I agree with that change is the only constraint t in our world today.

well-designed use cases help us to implement our requirements after doing some changes easily and quickly as we don't need to worry about unexpected scenarios. so the authors advise us to use our use cases to find out about things our customers forget to tell us.

The steps of your main path in the use case list must be the steps that will happen **most often** in your project, others will be the alternative path. from the start step to the end, we call this path a **scenario**, Most use cases will have several scenarios but they always have the same user goal.

Any time we do changes to our use cases the requirements change too, so after any change, we need to go back to our requirements and check them again. *Change is constant, and your system should always improve every time you work on it.*

# Chapter 04: Analysis

### Analysis
it is about figuring out potential problems, and then solving problems before you release your application out into the real world. 

Analysis and your use cases let you show customers, managers, and other developers how your system works in a real world context not just in your controlled environment -happy scenario-.

**Delegation** shields your objects from implementation changes to other objects in your software. it protect our code from changes due to changes happening to other objects.

**Textual analysis** is about looking at *`nouns`* in your use case to figure out *`potential classes`*, and *`methods`*.

Maybe You didn't use cases and still create good software, but it's good to use them to satisfy your customers more often. and it's good to make sure your software does what it's supposed to do.

Pay attention to the nouns in your use case, even when they aren’t classes in your system, because textual analysis helps us with what to focus on, not just what classes you need. in some cases you will found nouns in your use case but it's not really needed to be a class in your system. such as in the following example:

![](https://github.com/0xGhazy/0xGhazy/assets/60070427/cba12cf2-a91f-4158-a2b8-f12d100be83c)


in this example we didn't need to create a `Dog` class because we don't need to track the dog we just need its bark sound, or it's not making sense to store the dog in the dog door -*at least for me :)*-, and finally the dog is an external factor from our system.

Pay attention to verbs in your use case, it's usually the methods of the class in your system.

### Class diagram

![](https://github.com/0xGhazy/0xGhazy/assets/60070427/a9741a47-72c6-47cb-808b-73763f682457)

The class diagram contains some information about relationships between classes and inner components such as data members and methods.

from the image above we can see that:
- solid lines from one class to another are called "association" it means that one class is associated with another class by reference, extension, inheritance, etc.
- on that solid line we write the name of the attribute where the association takes place.
- the number at the end of the line is the number of attributes, if it's 1 it's called `multiplicity`, otherwise it's called `unlimited` and it's denoted by `*`.

class diagrams aren't everything because it has limited *type* information we don't know the data structure that uses them if we have iterable objects is it List, ArrayList, Vector, or custom objects. Class diagrams also don't tell us about how to code our methods, it's only give us a 10,000-foot view of our system as what authors mention on page 187.

at the end of this chapter remember that **rewriting code takes a lot more time than rewriting a use case or redrawing a class diagram**

# Chapter 5: Good design = flexible software

In this chapter authors will revisit the change concept that as we mentioned above its the only constant in our world :). we will talk about how to make your software more flexible and reusable, applays OO principles to achieve cohesion, and more. . .

## Part 1: Nothing Ever Stays the Same

this part of Chapter 5 starts with "The harder you make it for your software to change, the more difficult it’s going to be to respond to your customer’s changing needs.". this part focuses on the change concept and how we can make it achievable by using some OOP techniques.

`Abstract classes` are placeholders for actual implementation classes. we use these classes to define common behaviors that are needed in the classes that will extend the abstract class.

we can't create abstract class instances so we use them in general objects such as in the mentioned example in the book on page 200.

![1](https://github.com/0xGhazy/0xGhazy/assets/60070427/6e1a106f-0137-4bbe-b60f-ed9bdca222ea)

in this example we don't have an `Instrument` object in the real world it's just a placeholder for any kind of musical Instrument that we may need to add in the future.

*Whenever you find common behavior in two or more places, look to abstract that behavior into a class, and then reuse that behavior in the common classes*

abstract classes in the class diagram are denoted as *ClassName* in italics.

aggregation relationship means that one thing is made up of another thing. In this case, an object adds another object, such as a parent object.

One of the best ways to see if the software is well-designed is to try and CHANGE it. trying to change your software will prove that your software is good or not based on the ability to change easily.

**Great software isn’t built in a day** as you working on the project you will always find something to improve, and many problems in design to solve.

Coding to an interface, rather than to an implementation, makes your software easier to extend.

![Screenshot 2023-06-08 182037](https://github.com/0xGhazy/0xGhazy/assets/60070427/73a6cd88-39ca-45c4-8e55-07b5eefe563f)

When you run into a choice like this, you should always favor coding to the interface, not the implementation. 

By coding to an interface, your code will work with all of the interface’s subclasses even ones that haven’t been created yet. Instead of your code being able to work with only one specific subclass like `BaseballPlayer` you’re able to work with the more generic `Athlete`. That means that your code will work with any subclass of `Athlete`, like `HockeyPlayer` or `TennisPlayer`, and even subclasses that haven’t even been designed yet 🙂.

`Encapsulation` protect your classes from unnecessary changes.
*Anytime you have behavior in an application that you think is likely to change, you want to move that behavior away from parts of your application that probably won’t change very frequently. In other words, you should always try to encapsulate what varies.* Page 226.

Another thing to make your classes easy to change and not dependent is to have one reason to change, to achieve that you need to make your class do only one thing and do it well.

## Part 2: Give Your Software a 30-minute Workout

In this part, we will talk about how OO principles can really loosen up your application. And for the grand finale, you’ll see how higher cohesion can really help your coupling.

In this chapter, the authors changed the design in the first part after analyzing it and trying to apply what we learned in the first part of Encapsulation and others.

So you have to accept the idea of changing the design. Why didn't they do the correct design in the beginning? They wanted to prove that the design they showed you would be very good at a certain time, and it would not be easy for you to believe that it did not meet the purpose and needed modifications and additional work.

Design is iterative... and you have to be willing to change your own designs, as well as those that you inherit from other programmers.

Here we can feel the benefit of peer programming and that it helps us not to be completely impressed with our design, but there is criticism from the other side, which drives us to continuous development.

![p1](https://github.com/0xGhazy/0xGhazy/assets/60070427/dcefd364-5b76-4a3a-8897-43b123804b0e)

By encapsulating what varies, you make your application more flexible, and easier to change.

When you have a set of properties that vary across your objects, use a collection, like a `Map`, to store those properties dynamically.

You’ll remove lots of methods from your classes, and avoid having to change your code when new properties are added to your app

here we can use `Map<?>` instead of adding properties data members to the `InstrumentSpec` class.

the design will be like this:
![p2](https://github.com/0xGhazy/0xGhazy/assets/60070427/4a2188af-230e-4b8f-b01a-ae1bf3b5e366)

we can access the properties from the class:
```java
instrument.getSpec().getProperty(“builder”);
```

*Most good designs come from analysis of bad designs. Never be afraid to make mistakes and then change things around.*

Now, we ned to know about cohesion and cohesive class.

`cohesive class` *A cohesive class does one thing really well and does not try to do or be something else.* Page 269.

`Cohesion` *measures the degree of connectivity among the elements of a single module, class, or object. The higher the cohesion of your software is, the more well-defined and related the responsibilities of each individual class in your application. Each class has a very specific set of closely related actions it performs.* Page 269.

It's about how closely related the functionality of a class is in an application, module, or object. cohesion adds reusability and is easy to change.

**The more cohesive your software is, the looser the coupling between classes.**

At the end of this chapter, I would like to end it with the part I liked the most in the chapter, which is the question of **when is the design good enough and stop developing and improving?**

*Sometimes you just have to stop designing because you run out of time... or money... and sometimes you just have to recognize you’ve done a good enough job to move on. Spending hours trying to write “`perfect software`” is a waste of time; spending lots of time writing great software and then moving on, is sure to win you more work, big promotions, and loads of cash and accolades* Page 274.

it's hard to know when to stop, but we can say in general if our software does what it is supposed to do, it has a flexible and cohesive design, and customers are happy with it. we will be ready to move on to a new project.

# Chapter 6: Solving really big problems

In this chapter we will talk about the introduction to building big applications, I really love this chapter. It makes me feel good and excited about reading it.

We start by introducing how to solve big problems, You solve big problems the same way you solve small problems. As the big problem is just a set of small problems. so we just divide the big problems into small functional pieces and deal with each piece individually.

Dealing with big problems doesn't really require special magic tools or information. we can use the concepts that we use to solve small problems such as Encapsulation, coding against interfaces, writing use cases, keep it simple and able to change easily.

We need a lot more information to understand what we want to build then we can start writing the requirement list and use cases. We can gain more information by determining what our system is like (commonality/similar) and What is the system not like (variability/different).

After figuring out what is our system like and what is not, we can figure out what are features of our system are, Features are just a high-level description of something a system needs to do. Features and requirements are the same thing for some people and are not for others. we can say features are “big things” that lots of requirements combine to satisfy. That's what I prefer.

Use cases don’t always help you see the big picture, We need to keep our attention to get the big picture only without unnecessary details for now. So we can start drawing the *Use Case Diagram* we draw it when we need to know what a system does, but don’t want to get into all the detail that use cases require. here is an example of a use case diagram in the image below:

![image-2](https://github.com/0xGhazy/0xGhazy/assets/60070427/eba869ee-e38d-4d1b-b7fd-fd4537c2a14a)

A use case diagram is a blueprint for the system we wanna build, With a use case diagram, you’ll never forget about the big picture. identifying the features as we do before we can check them against the diagram to make sure it's complete.

Domain analysis lets you check your designs, and still speak the customer’s language, we’d never be sure we were building the right thing if we started talking about classes and variables. Here is an example of domain analysis:

![image-3](https://github.com/0xGhazy/0xGhazy/assets/60070427/7a2450b3-6d04-4ddc-b791-d42bf549862b)

**Domain Analysis**: The process of identifying, collecting, organizing, and representing the relevant information of a domain, based upon the study of existing systems and their development histories, knowledge captured from domain experts, underlying theory, and emerging technology within a domain.

Don’t forget who your customer really is, This is great advice at least for me. a lot of time I work on a project and get some thoughts about what if my customer is a developer. I need to add some features to make developers able to integrate my calculator into their systems 😃, I get a lot of work to do even if this project is small or big, it's maybe failed because additional features are not required for your real system users. Domain analysis helps you avoid building parts of a system that aren’t your job to build.

A design pattern is just a way to design the solution for a particular type of problem. So design patterns don’t go directly into your code, they first go into your BRAIN. we study them and learn how they were implemented and when to use them and when we can't use them, because each design pattern has its own trade-offs.

Our chapter is done now, I would like to document this moment right now. I was writing these chapter notes while I'm in the local cafeteria beside the Nile River and I asked for a coffee it was so bad but it cost 10 LE so it's fair 😁. See you in the next chapters.
