- Copy passwords to clipboard and QR Codes.
- Cool icons for social media platforms 😎.
- Hiding/Encrypting files and restoring them easily.

# PyPass Screens

## `Setup.py` script

First I need to setup application password by running `setup.py` script this will install all required libraries for the application and setup database tables.
here when you see the `Password>>` prompt we start type the main password to access our application in this case I put it `0000` to be easy and fast.

## Login Screen

when you start running the application you will see the login screen that asks you for the password you entered in setup phase. it checks if your password match the database record and incase of valid credentials you'll be redirected to main screen, and for invalid credentials you will get `Invalid Password !!` error message.

## Main Screen / Accounts

Here we are in the main screen that contains all tabs and navigations options, this screens consists of main 2 parts, the left part and the right one. in the left part such as `Accounts`, `Files`, `Settings` this all a navigation buttons that you can use to navigate through applications sections. the right part or the tab part it contains all features that you can do under this section such as list `saved accounts`, `add/edit/delete account` features for Accounts section as the image below.

in the following image, you will see the saved accounts list. by clicking on any account listed on the list the application will display the plaintext in the `QR code image` and `copy the plaintext password to clipboard`. so you can past it and use it as you want.
I hope no one try to scan the QR below and hack me 😢.

We can add new accounts in under the `Edit Accounts` Tab we typing the account data such as platform name to get the platform icon, email, and password. by clicking the add button  the account will be stored in our database.

We can also edit entered accounts by clicking on account from the accounts list and we will see account automatically filled and waiting for edit email/password/platform. by clicking on` update button` after changing the email data the account will be updated in the database. by clicking on the `delete button` the account will be deleted as you know :).

## Files Screen

Here we handle the file hiding functionality, we can import files from hard desk to our application. this feature is about reading files in binary format then encryption it using the security key and store the content in a encrypted file in the `saved-files` directory then store file details in the database like the following images.

`Export File` button will ask you where to export the original file on your hard desk after decrypting it. the `Restore File` button the file will be restored to the path that imported from.

In the Security section here we can import our encryption key or export it to store it in a backup media or uploading it to the cloud to be able to restore the files and passwords you entered earlier.

# Future Work and Acknowledgment

As you saw above, the application initially needs many important developments and additions, such as:
- [x] Importing/Exporting the database records as a backup method.
- [x] Implementing a chrome extension that able to manage passwords from the browser.
- [x] Adding the time-window ability to help the user to login one time a day then ask the user to re enter the owner password.

Since it is an open source application, I am happy to see your opinion and ideas on how I can improve this application more and more, and I am more and more happy that you participate in the development of this project if you will, even by suggesting or discovering bugs and report it by creating an issue.

Finally I wanna thank some people who contributing on PyPass application
